# WebScraping-from-Indeed-UK
This Python code basically searches for jobs with the title "Data Analyst" in London with a salary of more than 30000 Â£. Once the data from the URL is parsed, it is converted to a dataframe. Next the dataframe is converted to a tabular output. The tabular output is again converted to an image format. The conversion of html output to image output requires a huge amount of code, which was not possible for me to implement due to time constraints. Instead a third-party client PDFCrowd was used. PDFCrowd provides the user with a token and a simplified 5 line code which helps in converting the html output to an image format. The image is shared to the user's Twitter profile.
